This is a testfile for the spellchecker app. Any mispelled wordz should get recognized and outputtet into the ocnosle.
There the programmm also shows a suggestion of how to actually write the word. It does this by first storing all words formedt
the dictionary into a string vector, which we then sort. However since the dictionary itself is sorted this step can be skipped.
Then we take one word as input after another and search for it int the vector which contains all words from the dictionary. If it cannot find
the word, then it must be mispelled.
